# Learnify - A Robust Ed-Tech Platform with a RESTful API

Learnify is a modern educational technology platform built on a powerful MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The backend, developed with Node.js and Express.js, provides a well-documented RESTful API for seamless interaction with the React.js frontend.

Key backend features include:

* MongoDB for flexible and scalable data storage.
* JWT and Bcrypt for secure user authentication and password hashing.
* Mongoose for elegant MongoDB data modeling.
* Cloudinary integration for efficient media management.

The API follows REST architectural principles, utilizing JSON for data exchange and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for operations on resources like user accounts and courses.
## Front End

The front end  has all the necessary pages that an ed-tech platform should
have.

## Back End

The backend built using Node.js and
Express.js, and MongoDB as the primary database.

1. User authentication and authorization
2. Course management
3. Cloud-based media management(Cloudinary)
4. Node.js
5. MongoDB
6. Express.js
7. JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
8. Bcrypt is used for password hashing
9. Mongoose is used as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, providing a
way to interact with MongoDB using JavaScript
   

## API Design

9. /api/courses/:id (DELETE) - Delete a course by ID.
10. /api/courses/:id/rate (POST) - Add a rating (out of 5) to a course.
Sample API requests and responses: 
1. GET /api/courses: Get all courses
   * Response: A list of all courses in the database
2. GET /api/courses/:id: Get a single course by ID
   * Response: The course with the specified ID
3. POST /api/courses: Create a new course
